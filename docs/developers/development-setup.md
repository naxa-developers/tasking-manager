## Development setup

### Architecture

The Tasking Manager is composed of following services:

* **Frontend**: A user interface built using [react](https://react.dev/).
* **API Server**: API built using Python [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/).
* **Database**: [postgis](https://postgis.net/) used a Database
* **Reverse Proxy**: [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) is used as a reverse proxy. 

These services can be setup seperately or you can use existing [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) to spin all these resources.

As a developer you can setup backend & frontend code independently and work on it's development.

### Frontend

The client is the front-end user interface of the Tasking Manager. It is based on the React framework and you can find all files in the [frontend](../../frontend/) directory.

If you don't want to setup a backend server, you can work on frontend development using our staging server API. Execute `export TM_APP_API_URL='https://tasking-manager-staging-api.hotosm.org'` 
Before running the `yarn start` command. Be aware that the staging API can be offline while we are deploying newer versions to the staging server and that you'll not have access to some management views due to permissions. Check the [configuration](#configuration) section to learn more about how to configure Tasking Manager.

> **_NOTE:_**  If you have issues with login with Openstreet Account on your local setup, make sure `TM_REDIRECT_URI` is configured properly and it matches OAuth2 application's redirect url's that you created [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/oauth2/applications).

The following dependencies must be available _globally_ on your system:
* Download and install [NodeJS LTS v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* Go into the `frontend` directory and execute `yarn`.

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Backend

The backend is made up of a postgis database and an associated API that calls various end points to create tasks, manage task state, and produce analytics.

#### Dependencies

* [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Python 3.7 is what HOT uses in production. You can use Python 3.8 too.
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/install/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* [libgeos-dev](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/)

You can check the [Dockerfile](../../scripts/docker/Dockerfile.backend) to have a reference of how to install it in a Debian/Ubuntu system.

#### Configuration

There are two ways to configure Tasking Manager. You can set some environment variables on your shell or you can define the configuration in the `tasking-manager.env` file on the repository root directory. To use that last option, follow the below instructions:

* Copy the example configuration file to start your own configuration: `cp example.env tasking-manager.env`.
* Adjust the `tasking-manager.env` configuration file to fit your configuration.
* Make sure that the following variables are set correctly in the `tasking-manager.env` configuration file:
  - `TM_APP_BASE_URL`=web-server-endpoint
  - `POSTGRES_DB`=tasking-manager-database-name
  - `POSTGRES_USER`=database-user-name
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`=database-user-password
  - `POSTGRES_ENDPOINT`=database-endpoint-can-be-localhost
  - `POSTGRES_PORT`=database-port
  - `TM_SECRET`=define-freely-any-number-and-letter-combination
  - `TM_CLIENT_ID`=oauth-client-id-from-openstreetmap
  - `TM_CLIENT_SECRET`=oauth-client-secret-key-from-openstreetmap
  - `TM_REDIRECT_URI`=oauth-client-redirect_uri
  - `TM_SCOPE`=oauth-client-scopes

In order to send email correctly, set these variables as well:
  - `TM_SMTP_HOST`
  - `TM_SMTP_PORT`
  - `TM_SMTP_USER`
  - `TM_SMTP_PASSWORD`
  - `TM_SMTP_USE_TLS=0`
  - `TM_SMTP_USE_SSL=1` (Either TLS or SSL can be set to 1 but not both)

#### Build

* Install project dependencies:
    * Linux/Mac (Option 1: pep582):
        * First ensure the Python version in `pyproject.toml:requires-python` is installed on your system.
        * ```pip install --upgrade pdm```
        * ```pdm config --global python.use_venv False```
        * ```pdm --pep582 >> ~/.bash_profile```
        * ```source ~/.bash_profile```
        * ```pdm install```
    * Linux/Mac (Option 2: pip (system/venv)):
        * ```pip install --upgrade pdm```
        * ```pdm export --without-hashes > requirements.txt```
        * ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
> **_NOTE:_**  If you encounter any system level dependencies missing, please consult [Dockerfile](../../scripts/docker/Dockerfile.backend) for debian/ubuntu.
#### Tests

The project includes a suite of Unit and Integration tests that you should run after any changes

First source your environment variables
```
source tasking-manager.env
```
run your tests
```
python3 -m unittest discover tests/backend
```
or 
```
pdm run test
```

#### Export translatable strings to en.json source file

```
cd frontend && yarn build-locales
```


### Database

#### Create a fresh database

We use [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create the database from the migrations directory. Check the instructions on how to setup a PostGIS database with [docker](#creating-a-local-postgis-database-with-docker) or on your [local system](#non-docker). Then you can execute the following command to apply the migrations:

```
flask db upgrade
```
or 
```
pdm run upgrade
```
> **_NOTE:_**  If you are using `docker-compose` to create backend resources, flask migration is handled through docker service named `migration`.

#### Set permissions to create projects

To be able to create projects and have full permissions as an admin user inside TM, login to the TM with your OSM account to populate your user information in the database, then execute the following command on your terminal (with the OS user that is the owner of the database):

`psql -d <your_database> -c "UPDATE users set role = 1 where username = '<your_osm_username>'"`

# Docker
## Setup Tasking Manager with docker

If you have hard time setting up tasking-manager project manually, you can use the avalible docker compose configuration.

This setup can be used for development as well, you can choose the service you want to run.

### Dependencies

Following must be available locally:

* [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
* [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Understanding `docker-compose.override.yml`

`docker-compose.yml` file is not meant to be modified locally, if you want to have your own config you can make a copy of `docker-compose.override.sample.yml` and perform necessary changes here. 
This file is ignored through `.gitignore` so your changes won't be pushed upstream.
```
cp docker-compose.override.sample.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```
### Running docker containers

Once you have your `docker-compose.override.yml` created, make sure you have the environment variables configured as explained [here](#configuration).

> **_NOTE:_**  you should have `POSTGRES_ENDPOINT=postgresql`, where `postgresql` is the name of the docker service.

to start all the services:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
you should have frontend in http://localhost and backend accessible at http://localhost/api/
## Creating a local PostGIS database with Docker

If you're not able to connect to an existing tasking-manager DB, we have a [Dockerfile]() that will allow you to run PostGIS locally as follows.

### Build & Run the PostGIS dockerfile

3. You can now run the image (this will run PostGIS in a docker container, with port 5432 mapped to localhost):

```
docker run -d --name tasking-manager-db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=hottm -e POSTGRES_USER=hottm -e POSTGRES_DB=tasking-manager postgis/postgis:14-3.3
```

4.  Confirm the image is running successfully:

`
docker ps
`

5. Finally you can set your env variable to point at your containerised DB:

`
export TM_DB=postgresql://hottm:hottm@localhost/tasking-manager
`

6.  Refer to the rest of the instructions in the README to setup the DB and run the app


### API

If you plan to only work on the API you only have to build the backend architecture. Install the backend dependencies, and run the server:

`flask run --debug --reload` or  `pdm run start`

You can access the API documentation on [http://localhost:5000/api-docs](http://localhost:5000/api-docs), it also allows you to execute requests on your local TM instance. The API docs is also available on our [production](https://tasks.hotosm.org/api-docs) and [staging](https://tasks-stage.hotosm.org/api-docs/) instances.

#### API Authentication

In order to authenticate on the API, you need to have an Authorization Token.

1. Run the command line `manage.py` via `flask` with the `gen_token` option and `-u <OSM_User_ID_number>`. The command line can be run in any shell session as long as you are in the tasking-manager directory.

```
flask gen_token -u 99999999
```

This will generate a line that looks like this:
> Your base64 encoded session token: b'SWpFaS5EaEoxRlEubHRVC1DSTVJZ2hfalMc0xlalu3KRk5BUGk0'

2. In the Swagger UI, where it says
> Token sessionTokenHere==

replace `sessionTokenHere==` with the string of characters between the apostrophes (' ') above so you end up with something that looks like this in that field:

> Token SWpFaS5EaEoxRlEubHRVC1DSTVJZ2hfalMc0xlalu3KRk5BUGk0

Your user must have logged in to the local testing instance once of course and have the needed permissions for the API call.

You can get your OSM user id number either by finding it in your local testing/dev database `select * from users` or from OSM by viewing the edit history of your user, selecting a changeset from the list, and then at the bottom link `Changeset XML` and it will be in the `uid` field of the XML returned.

#### API Authentication on remote instance

To get your token on the production or staging Tasking Manager instances, sign in in the browser and then either:

- go to the user profile page, enable _Expert mode_ in the settings, and copy the token from the _API Key_ section.
- inspect a network request and search for the `Authorization` field in the request headers section.


# Non-Docker

## Creating the PostGIS database

It may be the case you would like to set up the database without using Docker for one reason or another. This provides you with a set of commands to create the database and export the database address to allow you to dive into backend development.

### Dependencies

First, ensure that Postgresql and PostGIS are installed and running on your computer.

### Create the database user and database

Assuming you have sudo access and the unix Postgresql owner is `postgres`:

```
$ sudo -u postgres psql
$ CREATE USER "hottm" PASSWORD 'hottm';
$ CREATE DATABASE "tasking-manager" OWNER "hottm";
$ \c "tasking-manager";
$ CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

Finally, add the environmental variable to access the database:

`
export TM_DB=postgresql://hottm:hottm@localhost/tasking-manager
`
## Openstreet OAuth2 Application
Tasking manager uses [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) account to authenticate users, for it to work on your local setup. You can create/login into [Openstreet map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/login)  and Create an OAuth2 Application [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/oauth2/applications).

Make sure `Redirect URIs` contains `http://<your-frontend-url>/authorized`

This should match the environment varible `TM_REDIRECT_URI` present in `tasking-manager.env` file.
```
TM_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3000/authorized
```
You will be provided with client_id and client_secret. You should have this value as `TM_CLIENT_ID` and `TM_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively in `tasking-manager.env` file.
